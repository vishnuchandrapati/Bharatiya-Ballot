# Bharatiya-Ballot
I led the development of an online voting platform aimed at making elections more accessible and transparent. We focused on creating a simple, secure way for people to vote online, ensuring their ballots were safe and the process easy to use. The platform also helped voters by providing clear, detailed information about each candidate.
